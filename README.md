This is a repository to analyze the language of policy reports. The original reports we analyzed with this code are from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. 

We have included some functions for document cleaning as well as the resulting words, both non-stemmed and stemmed.
We have also included the words and topic analysis conducted on peer EDSIN report to identify SJEDI keywords.
Finally we include all R files necessary to reproduce statistical results and visualizations.
